The OneStock application will be a central program that allows users to find vital information and data about stock products for all clients. The users will be able to find information such as descriptions, stock levels and breakdowns, Purchase order data and part script data as well as attributes and other notes. 

An agile design methodology will be implemented throughout the project to optimise workflow and achieve the best results for the client. The application will be developed using the C# programming language with the Visual Studio 2022 IDE. SQL data, tables, and stored procedures will be hosted on the SQL server, SQL-SSRS.
