This C\# WinForms application was developed to provide a centralized, efficient view of all relevant stock information. It streamlines inventory management by consolidating data from multiple sources into a single user-friendly interface, eliminating the need to navigate through various screens in the ERP system.

### **Project Context**

The initial version of this application was created to address a common pain point in inventory management: the need to access disparate stock data across multiple screens in the ERP being used. By centralizing this information, the application significantly reduces the time and effort required for stock-related queries. Over time, the application has been expanded with new modules to add more value and functionality to warehouse and operations teams.

### **Key Features and Functionality**

* **Centralized Stock View**: The core feature provides a single screen for users to view all relevant information for a given SKU, including current stock levels, locations, and other critical details.  
* **Stock Movement History**: A dedicated module allows users to track the complete history of stock movements for any item.  
* **Barcode Validation**: The application includes a feature to check and validate product barcodes, improving data accuracy and reducing errors.  
* **Automated Putaway System**: This module allows users to scan multiple returned items. It then generates an optimized "putaway walk sheet" that guides the user through the most efficient route to return items to their proper stock locations.  
* **ERP Integration**: The application can update stock locations within the ERP system, ensuring that physical inventory movements are accurately reflected in the digital records.

### **Technical Details**

* **Technology Stack**: The application was built using **C\# WinForms**.  
* **Database**: It communicates with **multiple SQL databases** to retrieve and manage stock information.

This project showcases my ability to develop a scalable application that solves a real-world business problem. The evolution from a simple data viewer to a multi-featured inventory management tool demonstrates a strong focus on adding value through continuous development and user-centric design.
